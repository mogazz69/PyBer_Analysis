# 1. Overview of the analysis:
> The purpose of this analysis is to visualise the PyBer data to have a better understanding of the ridership and fare metrics.

# 2. Results:
> In the analysis we find the number of total rides and and drivers is largest in Urban areas followed by suburban and lastly in rural areas with the least number of total rides and drivers, this leads to and increase in ride fares in rural areas.

# 3. Summary:
> In summary and after looking at the data I have 2 recomendations. First, we can simply continue as is since there is not an economically feasable way to increase the number of drivers in a rural area with an already low population as the best you can do is to promote the service and hope that the already small fraction residents/users adopt it. Or, we can add alternative and unconventional modes of transport such as horse carages, boats or even tractors to increase drivers/rideship and at the same time promote the diversity and the ease of adoptability of the rideshare app to capitalize on this niche rural market. If we are able to increase the driver count through this method, we will also be able to decrease the average fares as well.
